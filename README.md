# MemoPad_Tui

A simple terminal user interface (TUI) memo pad that behaves like sticky notes.
Notes are stored in `memos.json` in the working directory.

## Usage

Run the application from a terminal:

```bash
python memo_pad.py
```

- Use `a` to add a new note
- Navigate with arrow keys or `j/k`
- Press `d` to delete the selected note
- Press `q` to exit

The application saves notes automatically after adding or deleting.
